# About disjoint sets:
- Disjoint sets data structure, which is also known as Union-Find data structure, partitions a set of items. Each item is in exactly one set, and no intersection is allowed between two sets.
- The main opeartions are as follows:
  - Make-Set(x): create a new set {x}.
  - Union(x, y): combine the two sets, S1 and S2, in which the items x and y belong, respectively.
  - Find-Set(x): find the set, in which the item x belongs.
